# Weblog

This is the repository of my personal weblog.

The weblog is generated using [hugo](https://gohugo.io).

# Modify & check.

Run `hugo`:

```sh
hugo server -D
```

Once running, check the website by going on http://localhost:1313/weblog/


# Deploy

Just commit & push. The CI will generate the website & deploy it.
