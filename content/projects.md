My past & current projects:

* [Bitcoin balances](https://balances.crypto-nerdz.org), based on [chainstate](https://github.com/mycroft/chainstate), an UTXO database parser.
* [bgutil-rs](https://github.com/mycroft/bgutil-rs), an implementation of the [biggraphite](https://github.com/criteo/biggraphite)'s bgutil tool. Mostly developed to learn the biggraphite intervals during my journey in Criteo.
* [log-rebuilder](https://github.com/mycroft/log-rebuilder) - Send logs from a text files to rsyslog, rebuilding multiline log records.
* ???
* Profit!
