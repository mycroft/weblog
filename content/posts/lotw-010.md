Hi reader,

Guess who's back, back again? That's me! Well I'm back, but late. Last week I did not post anything due to... well... nothing. I've no excuse, just spent my time just doing something else. And don't ask me what, I do not even remember. My projects are going too slow at work, I feel like I spend a lot of time dealing with issues there and there and not doing the things I'd like to do.

Anyway. I spent 26 hours the last 2 weeks playing Two Points Museum. This is a good easy game. I like it.

The links I found interesting the last two weeks I bothered stacking in my reading list:

- [The 4th tmpout.sh issue](https://tmpout.sh/4/) - Younger, I did not spend enough time playing with the ELF format. I had a few friends (kudos!) who did, and I found that fascinating at the time. I'm really happy more people are bothering playing with those things nowadays. I sometimes think the old hacking scene is gone for good, and the good days are over. Ephemeral flashes like this tmpout.sh or the incomming (hoping!) phrack issue this summer makes me hope there are still a few real hackers out there. Thanks you guys!
- [The little book about OS development](https://littleosbook.github.io/) - One another thing I'd like to spend some time is OS dev. I'm not skilled enough to do it, and I sometimes wonder if I can get a little grisp at it.
- [200 deployments in production per day, Friday included: lessons learned](https://mcorbin.fr/posts/2025-03-21-deploy-200/) - I'm currently at a job and the build/deployment process is taking like 3 hours to complete. For less than 10 customers. My goal is to automatize those process and ensure running tests take less than 5 minutes, and deployment less than 10. The road will be load, very long, but not totally infeasible.
- [Common Misconceptions about Compilers](https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/common-misconceptions-about-compilers.html) - Last year I played a lot with lox (compiler/vm) and zig. My next goal was to read [Writing a C Compiler](https://nostarch.com/writing-c-compiler). Well, I'll have an advice: reading this blog post and navigating through the links bring a lot of insightful knowledge.
- [Can we communally deprecate git checkout?](https://mirawelner.com/posts/checkout.html) - Be honest: we use `git checkout` to switch branches. Well, there is `git switch` for you guys. Just use it!
- [Choosing Languages](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/choosing-languages/) - Stop suggesting using the right tool for the job, just do what you want to, as long as you're happy with it!

That's it for today. And for the week. I was writing this listening to Fayboy slim.

Everyone, have a great week.
