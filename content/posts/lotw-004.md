  What I've read and done this week.

Hi reader,

I'm not sure it was a really productive week. I even think this month was not that great. Sure, I've started my 3rd month in my new job and I'm still learning a lot, but I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing yet. However, I got like 20+ solicitations from recruiters this month, which seems like a good sign after a year 2024 totally empty. I'm not planning to change yet, but it's good to know I'm still in demand.

Well, at least this week I've finished playing [Zelda: TOTK](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Tears_of_the_Kingdom). Then I've started [Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%2B_Rabbids_Kingdom_Battle). I've also installed [Hoarder](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder) on my [kubernetes lab](https://github.com/mycroft/k8s-home/commit/32faa6f6e83955c6c32e6cc9b2695012d8d5f6e8). It feels fine, I'm moving some of the data I've put into Wallabag into it.

Links I found interesting this week were:

- [The Forty-Year Programmer](https://codefol.io/posts/the-forty-year-programmer/) - I'm not there yet, but I can say I agree with most advices and observations I got to read in this article;
- [Async Rust is about concurrency, not (just) performance](https://kobzol.github.io/rust/2025/01/15/async-rust-is-about-concurrency.html);
- I need to get myself into Rust web frameworks again. There is some stuff I need to get aware of. So I've dig into my bookmarks and found [Write a simple web service in Rust using hyper](https://blog.logrocket.com/a-minimal-web-service-in-rust-using-hyper/). I really need to get a deep look at [hyper.rs guides](https://hyper.rs/guides/1/);
- And as a final link to finish this post section: [Build A MMIO Booting Debian VM Out Of Cloud Images](https://imil.net/blog/posts/2025/not-so-smol-debian/).

Also, I've continued to write some code on some private tooling to make my work a bit easier. I'm not planning to opensource it at all. I'm not really sure it would be useful for somebody else.

Everyone, have a nice weekend and great week.
