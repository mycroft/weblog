Hi reader,

This week I've been completely busy with incoming migration at work on new tech. The team I joined recently have been working on a new project for like one year and we're having a bit time to make the migration easy. The incoming week will even more challenging. However, the project I've committed to working on is moving forward so I'm at least happy with that. I'm having a hard time disconnecting from work at night or during weekends. This is an issue I really need to work on.

I've continued playing [Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%2B_Rabbids_Kingdom_Battle). I'm about halfway through the game. I also saw the latest patch for [Baldur's Gate 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3) was released for testing. I guess it'll be the game I'll play next.

Links I found interesting this week were:

- [Introducting werk](https://simonask.github.io/introducing-werk/), a new small build system similar to `make`, written in Rust;
- [How I write backend](https://github.com/fpereiro/backendlore), a comprehensive guide to writing backend services;
- [Jujutsu VCS Introduction](https://kubamartin.com/posts/introduction-to-the-jujutsu-vcs/), an introduction to `jujutsu`. I've work quite a bit with this tool last year, and I can't lie, the tool looks like a lot more powerful than `git` in term of flexibility.

I've starting to move some of my personal projects' pipelines from [drone-ci](https://www.drone.io/) to [gitea actions](https://docs.gitea.com/usage/actions/overview). Drone was fine, but I don't need multiple build systems anymore. Having everything on gitea suits me well for now.

Everyone, have a great week.
