Hi reader,

This week I've found time working on my own project at work, at least a bit. I've also continued playing [Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%2B_Rabbids_Kingdom_Battle). I'm in the last chapter of the game. In my spare time too, I've been studying (again!) the git datastructures, writing some code in Rust to understand it better. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mycroft/mg) but it definitely needs some docs.

Links I found interesting this week were:

- [git-guts](https://awasu.com/weblog/git-guts/) - I'm the kind of person who likes understanding stuff reading code. Most git internals guides are written without a single line of code, and I was really happy to find out this page;
- [Great things about Rust that aren't just performance](https://ntietz.com/blog/great-things-about-rust-beyond-perf/) - I'll stop blogging when I stop finding Rust articles; I promise I should stop pasting the latest trending article. However, while I've been writing Rust code for a while, I'm starting to actually liking it;
- [7 things a developer should know about databases](https://blog.octo.com/7-things-a-developer-should-know-about-databases);
- [Jujutsu VCS Introduction and Patterns](https://kubamartin.com/posts/introduction-to-the-jujutsu-vcs/);

Nothing to add this week. There will be no update next week.

Everyone, have a great week.
