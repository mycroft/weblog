Hi reader,

It's been quite a while. Ok the weekly thing just became the monthly thing. Sorry, but I got quite busy the past weeks, despite I'm quite sure I won't have any answer to the question "but what did you do?". Sad, isn't it?

I'll be quick and go directly to the links.

- [Fedora 42 is out! (FR)](https://linuxfr.org/news/sortie-de-fedora-linux-42-la-reponse-a-la-grande-question-sur-le-libre-linux-et-tout-le-reste), and I'm already up to date!
- [Building my own AI toolbox: AI providers, contexts, RAG](https://mcorbin.fr/posts/2025-04-13-maizai-ai-toolbox/) - Somethind I need to work on. Last year, I worked a bit on [asoai - another stupid openai client](https://github.com/mycroft/asoai), but I'm not using it that much. I guess I should step up a bit in the AI game, just to know if I can be a bit more efficient.
- [20 years of Git. Still weird, still wonderful](https://blog.gitbutler.com/20-years-of-git/) - Git really evolved a lot since the [first commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290?ref=blog.gitbutler.com#diff-2b7814d3fca2e99e56c51b6ff2aa313ea6e9da6424804240aa8ad891fdfe0900). I can't believe it is like 20 years old. 10 years ago I was still using [Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion), like a lot of people I believe, and now everybody is using git.
- [Why I stopped using AI code editors](https://lucianonooijen.com/blog/why-i-stopped-using-ai-code-editors/) - Speaking of AIs, I'm aligning with the conclusion: _When you are using AI, you are sacrificing knowledge for speed._. What's important is what's done with it, and how it's done with it. As for now, I guess too much people is using badly.
- [Why I'm No Longer Talking to Architects About Microservices](https://blog.container-solutions.com/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-architects-about-microservices) - At my job I've the "luck" to not have anyone to talk technical things with people. And the sentence _discussions about microservices are often detached from any tangible business goals_ kinda triggered me: As I can not have the technical speeches to fix issues, I can not fix the issues. And it is bothering me.
- [PagedOut 6](https://pagedout.institute/download/PagedOut_006.pdf) was released a few weeks ago.

Well reader I'm gonna have a nap now so see you next time.
