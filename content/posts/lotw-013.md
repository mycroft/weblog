Hi reader,

Welcome to the 13th edition of my links of the week! May be I should rename it to "links of the month". Again, I'm late. And it is not even the week-end. Too much gaming. No excuse.

The links you're all waiting for:

- [The enshittification of tech jobs](https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/27/some-animals/#are-more-equal-than-others) - The golden age for tech workers is over. We, coders, are now building shitty products, why bad compensation (still good in my opinion, but way less than a few years ago.); And I'm not talking about the "AI" stuff. We're building stuff to make VC and shareholders happy, not the users.
- [How Discord Indexes Trillions of Messages](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-indexes-trillions-of-messages) - Another great article from the Discord tech team. Followup of their nearly 10 years old [How Discord Indexes Billon of Messages](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-indexes-billions-of-messages).
- [I built an AI code review agent in a few hours, here's what I learned](https://www.sourcebot.dev/blog/review-agent-learnings) - I'm building a bit something related with [asoai](https://github.com/mycroft/asoai) but I guess I should rewrite this from scratch.
- [How I program with LLMs](https://crawshaw.io/blog/programming-with-llms)
- [Go All the Way: Why Golang is Your Swiss Army Knife for Modern Development](https://blog.oodle.ai/go-all-the-way-why-golang-is-your-swiss-army-knife-for-modern-development/)

Things I need to experiment with:

- [RAG from scratch with Docker Model Runner](https://k33g.hashnode.dev/rag-from-scratch-with-docker-model-runner-part-1)
- [Goroutine Worker Pools in Go](https://goperf.dev/01-common-patterns/worker-pool/#when-to-use-worker-pools)
- [Creating a Model Context Protocol server in Go](https://eltonminetto.dev/en/post/2025-05-01-mcp-server-golang/)
- [Building Kubernetes (a lite version) from scratch in Go](https://medium.com/@owumifestus/building-kubernetes-a-lite-version-from-scratch-in-go-7156ed1fef9e)

That's all for today, folks. Have fun resolving problems and seen you soon!
