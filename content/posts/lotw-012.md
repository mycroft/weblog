Hello, readers!

This week links:

- [Simplifying Datastore Provisioning with Kubernetes Operators](https://zendesk.engineering/simplifying-datastore-provisioning-with-kubernetes-operators-a403d9ecd99c) - I wish I could work in a company running Kubernetes, so I could write some useful operator. There is a lot of useful things to do with operators.
- [Beej's Guide to Git](https://beej.us/guide/bggit/html/split/) - Today, Beej honors us with a comprehensive guide to Git.
- [Friends don't let friends write production software in Python](https://dustri.org/b/friends-dont-let-friends-write-production-software-in-python.html) - I'm in a python workhouse. All backend/ML code is written in Python. It is slow, really slow, slow to deploy, very expensive to run. I hope I could rewrite some parts in Golang or Rust.
- [Becoming a good engineer](https://0x0001.cc/blog/good-engineer.md) - A few hints to become/be a good engineer: understand the business, learn, communicate, learn, practice, learn, think, learn, apply, critique your own work, and learn reading the best books. Also write compilers.
- [You should make a new programming language](https://ntietz.com/blog/you-should-make-a-new-terrible-programming-language/) - You should make a new terrible programming language. See last link's comment for why.
- [Write your Own Virtual Machine](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) - No description from me for this one. Just check out the link.

Anyway I got COVID this week, and it's been like 4 days I'm ill with fever and everything. Just gaming, TVing, sleeping, and reading.

See you next week reader, if I get better.
