# Introduction

As I'm in the process of learning AWS & EKS, I decided to bootstrap from scratch, and completely, a basic EKS cluster using Terraform, and to deploy a couple of apps in it. I'm pretty much new to AWS (I mean, I've already played a bit with basic EC2 deployment & edited some security groups in the past, but that's mostly it).

This try-out is available in this [git repository](https://git.mkz.me/mycroft/infra-aws-eks).
