Hi reader,

Another week another record. I've an huge announcement to make. This week is 8th report and not 7th. The last time was indeed the 7th and not the 6th. You got me: I've not able to count up to 8 without messing up.

This week I spent really too much time working. I mainly spent my week fixing issues on different projects at work. I do not remember having coded anything for me. Surely I need to spend more time on my own projects.

Links I found interesting the last week:

- [How Core Git Developers Configure Git](https://blog.gitbutler.com/how-git-core-devs-configure-git/) - I've been using some ideas and I've integrated in my own `home-manager` configuration.
- [awesome docker compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master) - Last week I fucked up and linked some useless website about writing good docker files. I found out this repository to be really more useful.
- [hyperfine - A command-line benchmarking tool](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42177462)
- [Reviving an Old Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen](https://terminalbytes.com/reviving-kindle-paperwhite-7th-gen/) - Some fun project I could take a look at to re-use my old Kindle(s).
- [Operating System in 1,000 Lines](https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en/)
- [Is Rust a Good Fit for Business Apps?](https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/is-rust-a-good-fit-for-business-apps/) - Heck this blog post hurts a bit but is quite saying the truth. Rust is nice and offers a lot of possibilities, but it is an hard language to learn and practice. The conclusion is hard: _please think twice and don't make regrettable decision for yourself and your colleagues_.

Also, I've played a bit to _Two Point Museum_. And I watched too many Star Trek movies. No more comments for this week. Looking forward to next week.

Everyone, have a great week.
