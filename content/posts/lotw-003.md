Hi reader,

This week, David Lynch passed away. Despite I'm not that kind of guy watching a lot of movies, I felt a bit sad. Also, I still played [Zelda: TOTK](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Tears_of_the_Kingdom). Links I found interesting this week were:

- [Collection of insane and fun facts about SQLite](https://avi.im/blag/2024/sqlite-facts/) - I've been impressed by SQLite for like 20 years. And still is;
- [State of the Crates 2025](https://ohadravid.github.io/posts/2024-12-state-of-the-crates/) - A short but efficient list of crates to use when building software with Rust. I found out some crates I was using in the past are no longer maintained and my own list needs some cleanup;
- [What I Wish Someone Told Me About Postgres](https://challahscript.com/what_i_wish_someone_told_me_about_postgres).

I did not write that much code this week. Next week I need to install [Hoarder](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder).

Everyone, have a great week.
